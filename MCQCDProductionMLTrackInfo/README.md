# How to produce 2012 MC QCD events with Tracker Hits info from scratch with Pile-up (good for Machine Learning studies) 
This sample is an special one in the sense that it has use low-level tracking information with ML to create event-level or jetlevel classifiers,  also gives us position of pixel and strip tracker hits in simple ntuple-like format,this is useful because in AOD opendata files  no tracker rechits available.



We will produce these events in four steps.  First we perform the simulation up to the *SIM* step, then another step
up to the *HLT* simulation, then up to the reconstruction *RECO*, and then finaly extract information from a CMS root file type EDM  by
an EDAnalyzer in *NTUPLE* format. 

To start, first create a [VM](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/252 "CMS Open Data Portal") from the CMS Open Data website.

Then follow these steps:

- Create a CMSSW environment: 

    ```
    cmsrel CMSSW_5_3_32
    ```

- Change to the CMSSW_5_3_32/src/ directory:

    ```
    cd CMSSW_5_3_32/src/
    ```

- Initialize the CMSSW environment:

  ```
  cmsenv
  ```   

In this example we will use the code of an EDAnalyzer that will give us the information in NTUPLE format for this follow these steps:

- Obtain the code from git:

  ```   
  git clone -b 2012 git@github.com:cms-legacydata-analyses/EventProductionExamplesTool.git 
  ```   
- Change to EventProductionExamplesTool/MCQCDProductionMLTrackInfo directory 

  ```
  cd EventProductionExamplesTool/MCQCDProductionMLTrackInfo
  ```
- Compile everything:

  ```
  scram b
  ```
  
<!--Next, identify the configuration fragment that determines what physics event generator we wish to use and what topology we intend to generate. -->
In this example we will use the `QCDForPF_8TeV_cfi.py` fragment , which can be found in the [/Configuration/Generator/python](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_5_3_X/Configuration/Generator/python) area of CMSSW.  

##### Step 0: Generation and simulation

- Execute the *cmsDriver* command as:

```
cmsDriver.py QCDForPF_8TeV_cfi.py --fileout file:gensimQCD.root --mc --eventcontent RAWSIM --customise Configuration/StandardSequences/SimWithCastor_cff.customise,Configuration/DataProcessing/Utils.addMonitoring --beamspot Realistic8TeVCollision --datatier GEN-SIM --conditions=START53_V27::All --step GEN,SIM --datamix NODATAMIXER --python_filename gensimQCD.py --no_exec -n 10
```

Note that we put the naked name of our input fragment (*QCDForPF_8TeV_cfi.py*) because the script will look, by default, in
the */Configuration/Generator/python* area of the CMSSW release.  More information about the *--datatier* used can be found at the [CMS Workbook](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookDataFormats); that is the level of information we need/want in our ROOT output file.

Notice also that we have used
the `START53_V27::All` conditions, because this is the snapshot of the conditions database we need.  More information about this can
be found at the [CMS Guide for Conditions]( http://opendata.cern.ch/docs/cms-guide-for-condition-database) documentation.  As noted above, for this first step, step 0, we
only do the *GEN* and *SIM* parts of the whole chain.  We only generate 10 events for this example and choose the name of *gensimQCD* for the output files
in order to identify them correctly.

After executing this command, we will get the *gensimQCD.py* configuration file, which will be run with the *cmsRun* executable.  First, however, we need
to do a few modifications.

- Note that we need to be able to locate the database conditions as required by the *--conditions* switch.  Therefore, we need to make the following
 symbolic links:

```
ln -sf /cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch/START53_V27 START53_V27

ln -sf /cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch/START53_V27.db START53_V27.db
```

- Make sure the `cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch` directory has actually expanded in your VM.  One way of doing this is executing:

```
ls -l
ls -l /cvmfs/
```

You should now see the `cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch` link in the `/cvmfs` area.

- Open the *gensimQCD.py* config file with your favorite text editor and change the line

```
process.GlobalTag = GlobalTag(process.GlobalTag, 'START53_V27::All', '')
```

with

```
process.GlobalTag.connect = cms.string('sqlite_file:/cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch/START53_V27.db')
process.GlobalTag = GlobalTag(process.GlobalTag, 'START53_V27::All', '')
```
This sample is dedicated to studying 'boosted' events, that we need change the parameter pThat threshold  in a pythia generator v6 from pThat>15 to pThat>600 , for more information of this parameters visit [pythia documentation](http://home.thep.lu.se/Pythia/).

- For this in the *gensimQCD.py* change the line

```
'CKIN(3)=15.           ! minimum pt hat for hard interactions',
```
with

```
'CKIN(3)=600.           ! minimum pt hat for hard interactions',
```

- Run the CMSSW executable in the background

```
cmsRun gensimQCD.py > gensimML.log 2>&1 &
``` 

- Check the development of the job:

```
tailf gensimML.log
```


##### Step 1: HLT


- Execute the *cmsDriver* command as:

```
cmsDriver.py step1 --filein file:gensimQCD.root --fileout file:hltQCD.root --mc --eventcontent RAWSIM --runsScenarioForMC Run2012_AB_C_D_oneRunPerEra --datatier GEN-SIM-RAW --conditions=START53_V27::All --step DIGI,L1,DIGI2RAW,HLT:7E33v2 --python_filename hltQCD.py --no_exec --customise Configuration/DataProcessing/Utils.addMonitoring -n 10 --pileup_input root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/MonteCarlo2012/Summer12/MinBias_TuneZ2star_8TeV-pythia6/GEN-SIM/START50_V13-v3/0002/FEF2F4CC-0E6A-E111-96F6-0030487F1C57.root --pileup 2012_Summer_50ns_PoissonOOTPU
```

Note here that the ROOT file *gensimQCD.root*, which was obtained in the last step (step 0), serves as input for step1.  
We now process the event up to the high level trigger (HLT) simulation.  This command produces a file, *hltQCD.py*, which needs to be modified
like we did above.  I.e.,

- open the *hltQCD.py* config file with your favorite text editor and change the line

```
process.GlobalTag = GlobalTag(process.GlobalTag, 'START53_V27::All', '')
```

with

```
process.GlobalTag.connect = cms.string('sqlite_file:/cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch/START53_V27.db')
process.GlobalTag = GlobalTag(process.GlobalTag, 'START53_V27::All', '')
```
- In order to save the tracking hits information, change the line:

```
outputCommands = process.RAWSIMEventContent.outputCommands
```
with

```
outputCommands = process.RAWSIMEventContent.outputCommands+cms.untracked.vstring('keep *_simSiPixelDigis_*_*','keep *_simSiStripDigis_*_*'),
```

- Now, run the CMSSW executable in the background

```
cmsRun hltQCD.py > hltQCD.log 2>&1 &
``` 

- Check the development of the job:

```
tailf hltQCD.log
```


##### step 2: RECO (AOD)

- Execute the *cmsDriver* command as:

```
cmsDriver.py step2 --filein file:hltQCD.root --step RAW2DIGI,L1Reco,RECO,VALIDATION:validation_prod,DQM:DQMOfflinePOGMC --datatier AODSIM,DQM --conditions START53_V27::All --fileout file:recoQCD.root --mc --eventcontent AODSIM,DQM --python_filename recoQCD.py --no_exec --customise Configuration/DataProcessing/Utils.addMonitoring -n 10
```

Note here that the ROOT file *hltQCD.root*, which was obtained in the last step (step 1), serves as input for step2.  
We now process the event up to the final step: the reconstruction (RECO).  This command produces a file, *recoQCD.py*, which needs to be modified
like we did above.  I.e.,

- open the *recoQCD.py* config file with your favorite text editor and change the line

```
process.GlobalTag = GlobalTag(process.GlobalTag, 'START53_V27::All', '')
```

with

```
process.GlobalTag.connect = cms.string('sqlite_file:/cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch/START53_V27.db')
process.GlobalTag = GlobalTag(process.GlobalTag, 'START53_V27::All', '')
```

and change the line
```
outputCommands = process.AODSIMEventContent.outputCommands,
```
with
```
outputCommands = process.AODSIMEventContent.outputCommands+cms.untracked.vstring('keep *_simSiPixelDigis_*_*','keep *_simSiStripDigis_*_*','keep *_siPixelClusters_*_*','keep *_siStripClusters_*_*','keep *_g4SimHits_*_*','keep *_generalTracks_*_*'),
```

- Now, run the CMSSW executable in the background

```
cmsRun recoQCD.py > recoQCD.log 2>&1 &
``` 

- Check the development of the job:

```
tailf recoQCD.log
```

The resulting ROOT file, *recoQCD.root*, is in the same format as 
the MC and Data released by CMS.

##### step 3: NTUPLE
The instructions to write your own EDAnalyzer are [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookWriteFrameworkModule).
For this example use an existing EDAnalyzer called SaveHits for more information on the parameters within this can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/emanueleusai/opendatadnn/tree/master/SaveHits/SaveHits).

- Make a soft link to the python configuration file
  ```
  ln -s python/MLntupleQCD.py .
  ```

- Run the CMSSW configuration file
  ```
  cmsRun MLntupleQCD.py
  ```

##### As a result you will get a NtupleQCD.root file with simple variables and histograms.
